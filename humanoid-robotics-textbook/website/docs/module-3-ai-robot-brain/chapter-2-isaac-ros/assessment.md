### Intermediate Application (Short Answer)

6. **Explain how Isaac ROS Visual SLAM differs from traditional CPU-based SLAM approaches in terms of performance and capabilities.**

   **Answer**: Isaac ROS Visual SLAM leverages GPU acceleration to provide significantly faster processing speeds, enabling real-time performance with higher-resolution sensors. It can process more features simultaneously, resulting in more accurate mapping and localization. Traditional CPU-based approaches are limited by computational constraints and often require reduced sensor resolution or processing frequency to maintain real-time performance.

7. **Describe the integration pathway between Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Navigation2 stack.**

   **Answer**: Isaac Sim provides photorealistic simulation and sensor data generation. This data is transmitted via ROS 2 topics to Isaac ROS perception nodes which process the data using GPU acceleration for tasks like VSLAM, segmentation, and object detection. The processed data is then fed to the Navigation2 stack which uses it for localization, path planning, and navigation execution. The robot commands generated by Navigation2 can be fed back to Isaac Sim to control the simulated robot.

8. **What are the key configuration parameters that affect Isaac ROS Visual SLAM performance?**

   **Answer**: Key parameters include: max_num_features (controls feature density), min_num_features (minimum for tracking), use_gpu (enables/disables GPU acceleration), processing_frequency (rate of processing), camera_matrix (intrinsic calibration), and enable_loop_closure (enables drift correction). These parameters affect accuracy, performance, and resource utilization.

9. **Compare the advantages of using Isaac ROS with traditional ROS perception packages for humanoid robot navigation.**

   **Answer**: Isaac ROS provides GPU acceleration which enables real-time processing of high-resolution sensor data, better performance with complex perception tasks like segmentation, and optimized algorithms for NVIDIA hardware. Traditional ROS packages typically run on CPU and may struggle with the computational demands of humanoid robot perception tasks, especially with high-resolution cameras and complex environments.

10. **Explain how Isaac ROS handles sensor data synchronization for multi-modal perception.**

   **Answer**: Isaac ROS uses ROS 2's message filters and time synchronization mechanisms to align data from different sensors. It can synchronize camera images, IMU data, and other sensor streams using timestamp-based matching with configurable tolerances. The GPU-accelerated processing pipeline is designed to handle the parallel processing of multiple sensor modalities efficiently.
