## Diagram Specifications

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: SVG for diagrams (scalable), PNG for screenshots
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080 for screenshots
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent with the documentation theme
- **Annotations**: Clear labels and callouts explaining key elements
- **Accessibility**: Alt text describing each visual element

### Content Guidelines
- **Clarity**: Focus on the key concept being explained
- **Simplicity**: Avoid clutter and unnecessary details
- **Consistency**: Use consistent visual styles throughout
- **Accuracy**: Represent actual software interfaces correctly
- **Relevance**: Each visual should directly support learning objectives

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers
When creating these diagrams and screenshots:
1. Use consistent color schemes and fonts
2. Ensure high contrast for readability
3. Include proper licensing information for any tools used
4. Test visual aids on different screen sizes and resolutions
5. Provide alternative text descriptions

### For Content Reviewers
When reviewing visual aids:
1. Verify that visuals support the text content
2. Check that all diagrams are accurate and up-to-date
3. Ensure accessibility standards are met
4. Confirm that visuals enhance rather than distract from learning
5. Validate that all required visuals are included

## Additional Visual Resources

### Suggested Tools
- **Diagrams**: draw.io, Lucidchart, or similar
- **Screenshots**: Unity's built-in screenshot functionality
- **Annotations**: GIMP, Photoshop, or similar image editors
- **Screen Recording**: For animated tutorials

### Visual Asset Management
- Store all visual assets in a consistent location
- Use descriptive file names
- Maintain version control for visual assets
- Document the creation process for reproducibility

## Best Practices for Visual Creation

### For Screenshot Quality
- Use high resolution settings when capturing
- Ensure UI elements are clearly visible
- Capture both default and hover/active states
- Include multiple angles when showing 3D objects

### For Diagram Clarity
- Use consistent icon styles and colors
- Maintain proper spacing between elements
- Use arrows and lines to indicate relationships
- Include legends when multiple colors/types are used

### For Accessibility
- Provide detailed alt text for all images
- Use high contrast color schemes
- Include text descriptions for complex diagrams
- Consider colorblind-friendly color palettes
