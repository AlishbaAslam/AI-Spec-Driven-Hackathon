# Tasks Quality Checklist: AI-Robot Brain Educational Module (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Purpose**: Validate task list completeness and quality before implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [Link to tasks.md](../tasks.md)

## Task Format Compliance

- [X] All tasks follow the format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [X] All tasks have proper checkbox format (`- [ ]`)
- [X] All tasks have sequential Task IDs (T001, T002, etc.)
- [X] Parallel tasks are properly marked with [P]
- [X] User story tasks are properly labeled ([US1], [US2], [US3])
- [X] All tasks include specific file paths in descriptions

## Task Organization

- [X] Tasks organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3)
- [X] Phase 1 contains setup tasks
- [X] Phase 2 contains foundational tasks that block user stories
- [X] User story phases contain related tasks grouped by story
- [X] Final phase contains integration and polish tasks
- [X] User story tasks can be implemented independently

## Completeness

- [X] All user stories from spec.md have corresponding task phases
- [X] Each user story has implementation tasks covering all requirements
- [X] Setup phase covers project initialization
- [X] Foundational phase covers research and prerequisites
- [X] Integration phase covers cross-cutting concerns
- [X] All functional requirements from spec.md are addressed

## Quality Standards

- [X] Each task is specific enough to be executed without additional context
- [X] File paths follow the required directory structure (no nested folders in chapters)
- [X] Tasks are granular enough to be completed in reasonable timeframes
- [X] Dependencies between tasks are clear
- [X] Independent test criteria are achievable for each user story
- [X] Tasks align with the success criteria from the specification

## Directory Structure Compliance

- [X] All chapter content will be in separate directories per user requirement
- [X] No nested folder structures within chapter directories
- [X] All content files will be directly in chapter folders
- [X] Module directory structure follows: website/docs/module-3-ai-robot-brain/chapter-X-name/

## Notes

- Tasks are ready for implementation phase
- All quality requirements have been validated
- Ready to proceed with task execution
