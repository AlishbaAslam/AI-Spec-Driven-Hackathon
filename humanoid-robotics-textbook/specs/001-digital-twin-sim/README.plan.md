# Implementation Plan README

This README provides an overview of the planning artifacts for the digital twin educational module.

## Files

- `plan.md` - Main implementation plan with architecture, decisions, phases, and validation
- `quality-checklist.plan.md` - Quality validation checklist for the plan
- `spec.md` - Original feature specification
- `quality-checklist.md` - Quality validation checklist for the specification

## Planning Summary

The implementation plan outlines a phased approach to creating the educational module on digital twins using Gazebo and Unity:

1. **Setup and Foundation** - Establish Docusaurus site structure
2. **Physics Simulation Content** - Chapter 1 on Gazebo physics simulation
3. **Visualization Content** - Chapter 2 on Unity visualization
4. **Sensor Simulation Content** - Chapter 3 on sensor simulation
5. **Integration and Polish** - Combine all components and finalize

## Key Decisions Documented

- Technology stack: Gazebo + Unity for optimal physics accuracy and visual fidelity
- Content organization: Sequential chapters for focused learning
- Platform compatibility: Cross-platform support for maximum accessibility

## Next Steps

After plan approval, the next step is to generate detailed implementation tasks using `/sp.tasks`.
