# Tasks README

This README provides an overview of the task breakdown for implementing the digital twin educational module.

## Files

- `tasks.md` - Detailed implementation tasks organized by phase and user story
- `quality-checklist.tasks.md` - Quality validation checklist for the tasks
- `plan.md` - Original implementation plan
- `spec.md` - Original feature specification

## Task Organization

The tasks are organized into 6 phases:

1. **Setup** (T001-T004) - Project initialization and structure
2. **Foundational** (T005-T010) - Cross-cutting concerns and research
3. **User Story 1** (T011-T020) - Gazebo physics simulation content
4. **User Story 2** (T021-T030) - Unity visualization content
5. **User Story 3** (T031-T040) - Sensor simulation content
6. **Integration and Polish** (T041-T050) - Final integration and quality assurance

## Task Format

All tasks follow the format:
- `- [ ] T### [P?] [US?] Task description`
- Where [P] indicates parallelizable tasks
- Where [US1], [US2], [US3] indicate user story associations

## Execution Order

Tasks should be executed in the order specified, with parallelizable tasks ([P] flag) able to run concurrently when they don't depend on each other. User story phases can be developed independently after foundational tasks are completed.

## Next Steps

After task approval, implementation can begin following the task list in sequential order.
