# Tasks Quality Checklist

**Feature**: The Digital Twin using Gazebo and Unity
**File**: specs/001-digital-twin-sim/tasks.md

## Checklist

### Task Format Compliance

- [x] All tasks follow the required format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [x] All tasks have proper checkbox format (`- [ ]`)
- [x] All tasks have sequential Task IDs (T001, T002, etc.)
- [x] Parallel tasks are properly marked with [P] flag
- [x] User story tasks are properly marked with [US1], [US2], [US3] labels
- [x] Non-user-story tasks do not have story labels
- [x] All tasks include clear descriptions with file paths where applicable

### Phase Organization

- [x] Phase 1 contains setup tasks
- [x] Phase 2 contains foundational tasks that block user stories
- [x] Phases 3+ correspond to user stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3)
- [x] Final phase contains polish and cross-cutting concerns
- [x] Each phase has a clear goal statement
- [x] Each phase has independent test criteria

### Task Completeness

- [x] Tasks cover all aspects mentioned in the specification
- [x] Tasks align with the implementation plan
- [x] All user stories from spec have corresponding tasks
- [x] Foundational requirements are covered in Phase 2
- [x] Integration tasks are included in final phase
- [x] Quality assurance and validation tasks are included

### Dependencies and Parallelization

- [x] Dependencies between phases are clearly understood
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities are identified with [P] flag
- [x] Task dependencies are logically ordered
- [x] Blocking tasks are completed before dependent tasks

### Implementation Strategy

- [x] Tasks follow MVP-first approach
- [x] Tasks enable incremental delivery
- [x] Each phase results in independently testable increment
- [x] Tasks are specific enough for execution without additional context

### General Quality

- [x] Tasks are complete and self-contained
- [x] Language is clear and unambiguous
- [x] Tasks address all aspects of the specification and plan
- [x] The task breakdown is realistic and achievable
- [x] Tasks are testable and verifiable
- [x] All placeholders have been replaced with concrete information
- [x] Tasks follow template structure and format
- [x] Tasks are ready for implementation
